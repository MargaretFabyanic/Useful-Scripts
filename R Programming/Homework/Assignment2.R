#CS/IST 492 Assignment 2: Using R For Data Analysis
#Name:
#Due date: 4/5/19

#For the following functions, you can assume that all values you are using are numeric/integers. A sample matrix is provided here for you to test your functions (see how this matrix can help with evaluating?).
input_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 5, byrow = FALSE)

#1. Complete the following function. This function should take in a matrix/data frame and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient for every combination of columns in the matrix.
#Recall from class that this measure is used to evaluate linear correlation between two variables.
#For example, if you have a 5 column matrix, you would have to calculate the coefficient for the following pairs of columns: 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x5, 2x3, 2x4, 2x5, 3x4, 3x5, 4x5
#Note how it is not necessary to calculate 2x1 because you have already done so (it's the same as 1x2), this follows for 3x2, etc.
#As you calculate each coefficient, print to the console the results in the following format (Use column names if they exist, else column number is OK)
#<Column 1 Name> x <Column 2 Name>: <coefficient value between -1 and 1>
#<Column 1 Name> x <Column 3 Name>: <coefficient value between -1 and 1>
#...





#Lastly, your function should return a vector containing all of the calculated coefficients, stored in the order they were printed to the console.

#2. Write a function that computes the Information Gain (or Kullbak-Leibler divergence) for a specified variable in a matrix/data frame
#The function takes 3 parameters, the first being the matrix/df itself. The latter two specify the variables of interest, the first of which is the one you're trying to #find more information out about, the second of which you are provided to see how much information it can tell you about the first. Lastly, have this function return
#the calculated value.
